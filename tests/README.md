# Tests
These are the test files for the python utilities in
the parent directory. Note: they are slightly ghetto.

Each utility in r2pyutils has a corresponding test
file. To test the utility, simply run the test script.
Any failures will be noted. Run each script using
python as well as python3 to ensure interoperability
between both versions.
